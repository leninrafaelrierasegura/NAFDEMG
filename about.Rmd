The left and center plots display the convergence rates in $h$ and $\\tau$, respectively, on a $\\text{log}_{10}$–$\\text{log}_{10}$ scale, while the right plot shows the exponential decay in $m$ on a semi-$\\text{log}_{e}$ scale, with $m$ plotted on a square-root scale. Dashed lines indicate the theoretical rates, and solid lines represent the observed error curves. The legend below each plot shows the value of $\\alpha$ along with the corresponding theoretical ('theo'), and observed ('obs') rates for each case.")}
